# Frontend Setup Guide: Building the AI Chat Interface

## Quick start (local)
1) cd frontend && npm install
2) Configure env: create .env.local
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=http://localhost:3001
3) npm run dev

## Production (Vercel)
- Set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE to your backend base URL (e.g., https://your-backend.example.com). Do not include /api; the app will append it.
- The frontend never talks to Ollama directly; all chat and RAG calls go to the backend.

## RAG UX
- Toggle RAG mode from the chat header. Upload PDFs/text to enrich answers.
- The UI shows responses even when generation fails by refetching persisted fallbacks.

## Provider configuration UI
- OpenAI: requires apiKey and model.
- Ollama: apiKey optional. In production, baseUrl must be a public HTTPS tunnel (e.g., PageKite). In dev, localhost is fine.

## üéØ Overview

This guide walks you through recreating the frontend from scratch, building a modern React-based chat interface with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and advanced state management. While focusing primarily on backend architecture, this frontend guide shows how to create a responsive, performant UI that seamlessly integrates with our AI backend.

## üèó Project Foundation

### 1. Initialize Next.js 15 Project

Create a new Next.js project with the latest features:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest ai-chat-frontend --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app
cd ai-chat-frontend
```

This command sets up Next.js 15 with the App Router, TypeScript integration, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint configuration. The App Router provides modern routing with layouts, server components, and streaming capabilities.

### 2. TypeScript Configuration Strategy

The TypeScript setup enables full-stack type safety:
- Strict mode for comprehensive error catching
- Path mapping for clean imports (`@/components`, `@/lib`)
- Next.js plugin integration for enhanced development experience
- Incremental compilation for faster builds

This configuration ensures type safety across the entire frontend codebase and provides excellent developer experience with IntelliSense and error detection.

### 3. Essential Dependencies Installation

**Core Framework:**
- `@tanstack/react-query` - Server state management with intelligent caching
- `axios` - HTTP client for API communication
- `react-hook-form` - Form handling with minimal re-renders
- `sonner` - Toast notifications for user feedback

**UI Components:**
- `@radix-ui/react-*` - Accessible UI primitives
- `class-variance-authority` - Component variant management
- `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` - Conditional styling utilities
- `lucide-react` - Modern icon library

**Development:**
- `@types/node` - Node.js type definitions
- `eslint-config-next` - Next.js specific linting rules

## üé® Styling Architecture with Tailwind CSS

### Design System Implementation

The styling system uses Tailwind CSS with a custom design system:

**Color System:**
- CSS custom properties for theme flexibility
- HSL color space for better manipulation
- Dark/light mode support through CSS variables
- Semantic color naming (primary, secondary, destructive, etc.)

**Component Variants:**
- Class Variance Authority for type-safe component variants
- Consistent sizing scales across all components
- Responsive design patterns built into component system
- Accessibility considerations in all component states

### Shadcn/ui Integration

The component library follows a copy-paste approach:
- Components are added to your codebase, not installed as dependencies
- Full customization control over styling and behavior
- Built on Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- Consistent API across all components

This approach gives complete control over the component library while maintaining consistency and accessibility standards.

## üîÑ State Management Architecture

### TanStack Query Implementation

The state management strategy uses TanStack Query for server state:

**Query Management:**
- Automatic background refetching for fresh data
- Intelligent caching with stale-while-revalidate patterns
- Optimistic updates for immediate UI feedback
- Error boundary integration for robust error handling

**Cache Strategy:**
- 5-minute cache for configuration data
- 30-second cache for chat messages
- Aggressive invalidation on mutations
- Background refetching for real-time updates

**Custom Hooks Pattern:**
- `useActiveConfiguration` - AI provider settings
- `useChatHistory` - Message retrieval with session support  
- `useSendMessage` - Message sending with optimistic updates
- `useUploadDocument` - File upload for RAG functionality

### Local State Management

Local component state uses React hooks effectively:

**useState for UI State:**
- Form inputs and temporary UI state
- Modal and dropdown visibility
- Loading states and user interactions

**useEffect for Side Effects:**
- Local storage synchronization
- URL parameter management
- Event listener setup and cleanup

**useCallback and useMemo:**
- Performance optimization for expensive calculations
- Stable references for child components
- Memoized derived state computations

## üí¨ Chat System Implementation

### Real-time Chat Architecture

The chat interface implements sophisticated message handling:

**Message Flow:**
1. User input validation and sanitization
2. Optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback  
3. API request with error handling and retries
4. Response streaming for real-time AI responses
5. Message persistence with session management
6. UI updates with loading states and animations

**Session Management:**
- Persistent sessions across browser refreshes
- URL-based session routing for deep linking
